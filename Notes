Java 8 Features
1)Default methods in interfaces
2)Static methods
3)Functional Interfaces
4)Lambda Expressions
5)Stream API
6)Date-time API
7)Predefined Functional Interfaces(Predicates,Functions,Customer,Supplier)
8)Method Reference
9)Functions
10)Constructor Reference

==>Why Java SE(Standard Editions) 8 is important
1)It simplifies the programming by lambda expressions.
2)Lambda expressions inherit the features of "functional programming languages",
still java is an object oriented programming language.
3)It supports multi threaded .
4)It utilizes multi core processors.


1)Default methods in interfaces
a)any method which is implemented in all classes , can now come under interface only ,
so each class will not have to implement it again  and again, reducing LOC's.
b)implemented classes can have their own implementation.(can be overridden).
c)Should have  a body

2)Static methods in interfaces ::
a)have to use public access modifier
b)Cannot override methods
cannot do Interface_Name Interface_Variable_Name=new Class_Name();

c)any static method which is implemented in interface , will not belong to implemented class.
d)Should have a body.

3)Marker Interface
a)if any interface is not having any abstract method.
Example:Cloneable

4)Functional Interfaces
a)any interface is having exact one abstract method.
b)use @FunctionalInterface annotation, but not compulsory
C)Examples:Comparable interface

5)Annotations:
provide additional information about program


6)=======================Lambda Expressions=======
a)it is a function which does not have
i)name ii)modifier iii)return type
b)It reduces LOC
c)call API's effectively.
d)supports parallel and sequential execution
e)always used with functional interfaces

7)Rules for lambda expressions
a)can avoid curly braces for one statement within lambda expression
b)() of lambda function can take any arguments
c)Providing data type with arg is optional.
d)if we have one parameter , can also remove ()
e)If lambda expression is returning any value , without curly braces do not use return.
  with curly braces , use return .Use curly braces for multiple statements.

8)Stream API
a)Stream API is related to collection framework or group of objects
b)Use of Stream API:
i)it is use to perform bulk operations on collection objects.
ii)It decreases the LOC.

c)Hierarchy of Stream API:

d)Stream operations lifecycle:
i)Get stream from the source and get stream instance
ii)Perform operations as many (filter(),map(),sorted())
iii)Transform it to another stream
iv)Perform the terminal operations(count(),sum())

e)Stream Interface:
i)An interface Present in util.stream
ii)it has methods :forEach(),filter(),map(),collect(),min(),max(),count()
iii)some static methods :of(){},empty(){},builder(){}
